This is a repository for my older course works and school projects. 
The projects were means to ends,familiarization, and aids rather 
than the ends themselves. Upgrades are not yet scheduled as of the 
time of writing.

Do look into each folder and take a look at the usage manual pdf 
to get the overview of the project and see some cool images and figures, 
cheers!
